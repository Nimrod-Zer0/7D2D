How To Use:
</br> 
If you do NOT already have a folder named "Mods" in your 7 days to die file, then you can create a new folder named "Mods" (without quotes) then copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into it.
If you already DO have a "Mods" folder, then you can simply copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into your "Mods" folder.
</br></br>
Any mods in your 'Mods' folder will automatically be detected and run when your game is started.
if you want to remove any mods simply remove them from the 'Mods' folder. 
</br></br>
This mod is safe to use/remove at any time. there have been many times where i used and then removed mod during same singleplayer session with NO issues.</br>Dedicated server owners only need to have this mod running on server and all changes will propagate to clients when they join.

</br>

Note:
</br>
This is just me playing/testing/learning the xpath mod sytem.
There is barely any documentation on xpath usage for 7 days to die and none of it is official from fun pimps.
If you're running a dedicated server you need only run this mod on the server and any clients will automatically recieve the updated Mod info.
</br></br>
I have no idea what happens when using multiple mods (using the xpath system) at the same time so i would not recommend it unless you are specifically testing compatibility and are aware that there may be issues or crashes.
