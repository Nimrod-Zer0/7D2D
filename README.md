7 Days To Die (A18 Mods)

NRZ_7JankTweaks

Description:
</br>
	7JankTweaks makes many small changes to enhance gameplay and make it a bit more challenging while staying true to the games vanilla core gameplay.

       


Features:
</br>
	All Animal hitpoints have been adjusted.
				Added bleeding back into zombie immunitys. (Severely stupid the devs made ZOMBIES be able to bleed to death)</br>
				Removed the weather survival buff given to fresh spawns. (you should know if its hot/cold from the start, not find out after you already started to build in area you started at)</br>
				Increased zombie loot drop chance to 5% from 2%.</br>
				Added Food, Water and Core Temp Bars to main hud.</br>
				Removed ability to craft any weapon or tools from workbench. (i feel crafting max quality weapons/tools takes away from looting in a game where you are suppose to go looting)</br>
				Adjusted light brightness, speed and handling of bike, minibike, motorcycle and 4x4.</br>
				Plants/crops can be picked up by pressing E again. (Note: player crops can be picked up, but hitting it will harvest it and leave seed like vanilla game)</br>
				Traders have more item count variance. (min/max items they may have)</br>
				Removed burnt forest dark smoke. (haze and light smoke still there)</br>
				Adjusted Hypo/Hyper thermal Resistance of most wearable items. (putting on a puffer coat in desert on a hot day will now massively raise your heat not lower it)</br>
				Burning barrels now give off heat like lit campfire does.</br>
				Adjusted min/max temperatures for Snow biome. (can get slightly warmer or much colder. so right clothes matter now to survive)</br>
				Adjusted min/max temperatures for Desert biome. (slightly lowered max temp due to clothing changes. so right clothes matter now to survive)</br>
				Removed Irradiated zombies. (They are replaced with feral versions of same type)</br>
				Adjusted all meat harvest values of animals.	(you no longer need 5 meat to make 1 cooked meat basically)</br>
				Adjusted meat req of food recipes to be crafted. (you no longer need 5 meat to make 1 cooked meat basically)</br>
				Adjuster gascan req for explosive items to be crafted.</br>
				Adjuster gunpowder req for explosive items to be crafted.</br>
				Adjusted the amount of gas you can get from fuel pumps, barrels and cars.</br>
				Adjusted gunMR10 to have a 10 round magazine.</br>
				Adjusted handling and kick of AK47 and M60. (funpimps gave this weapon the best handling and least recoil of any other weapon for some reason)</br>
				Adjusted handling of smg. (slightly better handling)</br> 
				Reduced melee reach of zombies a bit.</br> 
				Added a bit more variance to how long a zombie can stand back up after being knocked down.</br>
				Increased Demolisher zombie melee and explosion damage. (to be more a threat in late gamestages)</br>
				Increased Cop zombie explosion & spit damage. (Acid damage multiplier: Metal = 4X, Stone = 1.5X, Wood = 0.5X)

How To Use:
</br> 
If you do NOT already have a folder named "Mods" in your 7 days to die file, then you can create a new folder named "Mods" (without quotes) then copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into it.
If you already DO have a "Mods" folder, then you can simply copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into your "Mods" folder.
</br></br>
Any mods in your 'Mods' folder will automatically be detected and run when your game is started.
if you want to remove any mods simply remove them from the 'Mods' folder. 
</br></br>
This mod is safe to use/remove at any time. there have been many times where i used and then removed mod during same singleplayer session with NO issues.</br>Dedicated server owners only need to have this mod running on server and all changes will propagate to clients when they join.

</br>

Note:
</br>
This is just me playing/testing/learning the xpath mod sytem.
There is barely any documentation on xpath usage for 7 days to die and none of it is official from fun pimps.
If you're running a dedicated server you need only run this mod on the server and any clients will automatically recieve the updated Mod info.
</br></br>
I have no idea what happens when using multiple mods (using the xpath system) at the same time so i would not recommend it unless you are specifically testing compatibility and are aware that there may be issues or crashes.
