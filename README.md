7 Days To Die (Mods)

NRZ_7JankTweaks

Description:
</br>
	NRZ_7JankTweaks makes many small changes to enhance gameplay and make it a bit more challenging while staying true to the games vanilla core gameplay.

       


Features:
</br>
	Zombie dog, wolf, direwolf and both vulture types have less hp.
	</br>
	Yucca fruit has smaller chance of food poisoning.
	</br>
	Added bleeding back into zombie immunitys. (Severely stupid the devs made ZOMBIES be able to bleed to death)
	</br>
	Removed the weather survival buff given to fresh spawns. (you should know if its hot/cold from the start, not find out after you already started to build in area you started at)
	</br>
	Increased zombie loot drop chance to 10% from 2%.
	</br>
	Added Food and Water Bars to main hud.
	</br>
	Crouching no longer gives massive damage increase. (why would crouching make any projectile do more damage..lol)
	</br>
	All weapons now have weapon damage modifier based on quality (higher quality weapons do more damage).
	</br>
	Removed seveal perks that didnt make any sence or made player way to over powered.
	</br>
	Adjusted light brightness, speed and handling of bike, minibike, motorcycle and 4x4.
	</br> 
	Guns can NOT be crafted (removed from workbench so flawless guns cant be crafted from scraps)
	</br>
	Plants/crops can be picked up by pressing E again.
	</br>
	Traders have more item count variance (min/max items they may have).
	</br>
	Removed burnt forest dark smoke (haze and light smoke still there).
	</br>
	Adjusted Hypo/Hyper thermal Resistance of dusters, jackets, sweatshirts, and scrap, iron, steel armors. (putting on a puffer coat in desert will now raise your heat not lower it).
	</br>
	Burning barrels now give off heat like lit campfire does.
	</br>
	Snow biome min/max temps adjusted (can get much colder so right clothes matter now to survive).
	</br></br>

How To Use:
</br> 
If you do NOT already have a folder named "Mods" in your 7 days to die file, then you can create a new folder named "Mods" (without quotes) then copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into it.
If you already DO have a "Mods" folder, then you can simply copy the NRZ_7JankTweaks folder into your "Mods" folder.
</br></br>
Any mods in your 'Mods' folder will automatically be detected and run when your game is started.
if you want to remove any mods simply remove them from the 'Mods' folder. 
</br></br>
This mod is safe to use/remove at any time. there have been many times where i used and then removed mod during same singleplayer session with NO issues.</br>Dedicated server owners only need to have this mod running on server and all changes will propagate to clients when they join.

</br>

Note:
</br>
This is just me playing/testing/learning the xpath mod sytem.
There is barely any documentation on xpath and none of it is official from fun pimps.
If you're running a dedicated server you need only run this mod on the server and any clients will automatically recieve the updated Mod info.
</br></br>
I have no idea what happens when using multiple mods (using the xpath system) at the same time so i would not recommend it unless you are specifically testing compatibility and are aware that there may be issues or crashes.
