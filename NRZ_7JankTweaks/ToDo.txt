This is a list of future changes to game i would like to eventually do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjust Perks.
    Some are just stupid and dont make ANY sence.  lol
    like the faster fire rate for automatic weapons. HOW? by some how pulling the trigger differently?  --  WTF :)
    
    Note:
        unfortunatly due to the limitations of the way xpath is implemented, text files are locally stored and do NOT propogate from dedicated server.
        so while adjustments can be made and even completely new perks added, it would require anyone who plays on the server to all have the same mod files installed locally on there pc.
        until the devs install the propper hooks for this functionality its not worth making any adjustments at this time.

Game stages are stupid. 
    players level should NOT dictate what type of zed spawns and number of them. especially in Multiplayer where it defaults to highest player near you.
    The zombie group should be a list of all zombie types that has a random number of them spawn. 
    You should be able to get a wandering horde anywhere from 3 to 150 zombies at anytime when a wandering horde is due for example.


Add chance of food poison to canned items (simulate canned goods that have expired). 
	sadly this doesnt appear possible the way devs have setup the system as it only reads a singular set value.
	if the devs ever enter a getter function to retrieve a random value then this could be easily done.
    until then its not worth my time.

Lock picks 
    lock picks should also work on locked doors. (currently they only work on safes)
    the issue with this would be player doors (like base doors).

Remove sneak damage
    crouching down 2 inches should NOT make any weapon somehow do at least 2X more damage. 


Pretty much everything mentioned above is not worth the time or makes the mod more then just some small tweaks.
we can only hope that the devs reconsider some of these goofy decisions and fix it themself.
