			(10-10-2019) v1.0:
				All Animal hitpoints have been adjusted.
				Added bleeding back into zombie immunitys. (Severely stupid the devs made ZOMBIES be able to bleed to death)
				Removed the weather survival buff given to fresh spawns. (you should know if its hot/cold from the start, not find out after you already started to build in area you started at)
				Increased zombie loot drop chance to 5% from 2%.
				Added Food, Water and Core Temp Bars to main hud.
				Removed ability to craft any weapon or tools from workbench. (i feel crafting max quality weapons/tools takes away from looting in a game where you are suppose to go looting) 
				Adjusted light brightness, speed and handling of bike, minibike, motorcycle and 4x4. 
				Plants/crops can be picked up by pressing E again. (Note: player crops can be picked up to but hitting it will harvest and leave seed like vanilla game)
				Traders have more item count variance. (min/max items they may have)
				Removed burnt forest dark smoke. (haze and light smoke still there)
				Adjusted Hypo/Hyper thermal Resistance of most wearable items. (putting on a puffer coat in desert on a hot day will now massively raise your heat not lower it)
				Burning barrels now give off heat like lit campfire does.
				Adjusted min/max temperatures for Snow biome. (can get slightly warmer or much colder. so right clothes matter now to survive)
				Adjusted min/max temperatures for Desert biome. (slightly lowered max temp due to clothing changes. so right clothes matter now to survive)
				Removed Irradiated zombies. (They are replaced with feral versions of same type)
				Added both houseFrontDoor items to tablesaw item so they can be crafted.
				When chopping houseFrontDoor items there is a chance to get brass.
				Adjusted all meat harvest values of animals.	(you no longer need 5 meat to make 1 cooked meat basically)
				Adjusted meat req of food recipes to be crafted. (you no longer need 5 meat to make 1 cooked meat basically)
				Adjuster gascan req for explosive items to be crafted.
				Adjuster gunpowder req for explosive items to be crafted.
				Adjusted the amount of gas you can get from fuel pumps, barrels and cars.
				Adjusted gunMR10 to have a 10 round magazine.
				Adjusted handling and kick of AK47 and M60. (funpimps gave these weapons the best handling and least recoil of any other weapon for some reason)
				Adjusted handling of smg. (slightly better handling) 
				Reduced melee reach of zombies a bit. 
				Removed extra weapon handling player got from installing laser sight item on weapon. (laser sight aids aiming, it does nothing for recoil or handling)
				Removed extra weapon handling player got from installing reflex sight item on weapon. (reflex sight aids aiming, it does nothing for recoil or handling)
				Slightly increased extra weapon handling player got from installing foregrip item on weapon.
				Reduced the amount of recoil reduction the foregrip item gives when installed on a weapon. (funpimps had it at 50% reduction when installed)
				Added a bit more variance to how long a zombie can stand back up after being knocked down.
				Adjust Hypo/Hyper thermalResist of hat skins to match the actual item.

			(10-25-2019) v1.2:

				Increased damage of spears on cloth panels. (can now destroy cloth panels in 1 hit)

			(11-22-2019) v1.2.1:
				Removed code that prevented crafting of weapons and tools. 
				
					Reasoning - In a game where you should be out looting i find it very stupid you can unlock a skill or read a book that allows crafting any weapon or tool up to max tier.
        			however, after a recent debate with a good friend he pointed out that this is the 1 thing in the mod that removes a game feature (crafting tools and weapons).
        			therefor i am leaving the code in here but commenting it off so its not active. if you should want to use it simply unblock it.

					This mod is all about small changes weather it be for quality of life or small balance adjustments, it should not remove any major features of the game. 
					This mod is meant to be modular and at minimum an example of how to use xpath for modding. not everyone is going to like every change so simply remove the change or adjust it to your likeing.
